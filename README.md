# AI-POWERED LUNG CANCER SCREENING

Lung cancer is a major worldwide health threat, accounting for one of the main causes of cancer-related death. The stage at which the cancer is identified is a crucial factor influencing patient survival. Hence, early identification is a challenge as it broadens therapy choices and improves patient outcomes. This project revolves around classification of 25,000 histopathological images of lung tissue from a diverse dataset into five distinct categories. A Vision Transformer (ViT) model and a hybrid Xception + MobileNet architecture are the models used for this task.
